# Chapter 1

## 1.1 Scalar Functions

#### Functions' basic vocabulary

a function $f: A->B$

**image**

a function $f: A->B$ associates with each element $a \in A$ a *unique* element $f(a)\in B$ called the **image** of $a$ under $f$

**domain**

the set $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$ and is denoted by $D(f)$.

**codomain**

the set $B$ is called the **codomain** of $f$.

**range**

the subset of $B$ consisting of all $f(a)$ is called the **range** of $f$ and is denoted $R(f)$.

### Def: Scalar Function

a **scalar function** $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ of $n$ variables is a function whose domain is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and whose range is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$

explain:

extend: single variable calculus => several variables

usually look at real functions of two variables whose *domain* is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and whose *codomain* is $mathbb{R}$

that is:

consider function $f$ which map point $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}$, we write $z=f(x,y)$

the more general form is $f(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ which map subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $R$.

remark:

$f(x,y)$ donotes the value of the function $f$ at the point $(x,y)$,

it is common practice to use "the function $f(x,y)$" --- stress which independent variables the function is dependent on.

#### Example 1 (find the image)

let $f$ be defined by $f(x,y)=2x+3y+1$ find $f(1,-4)$ and $f(1,1)$

sol: 代入 answer = $9$, $6$

#### Example 2 (find the domain and range)(domain)

note: we can find domain with a picture

find the domain and and range of $f(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}$

sol:
![](\pics\math\math237-1.1.PNG)

$xy\ge 0$ , thus the **domain** is $x \ge 0, y\ge 0$ and $x\le 0, y\le 0$

**range** $f(x,y)=\sqrt{xy}\ge 0$

#### Example 3 (find the domain and range)(range)

find the domain and range of $g(x,y)=\frac{x^2 -y^2 }{&#124;x&#124; + &#124;y&#124;}$

sol:

$g$ is undefined whenever $(x,y)=(0,0)$. so, the domain is $\mathbb{R}^2 -{(0,0)}$

the range is a little more difficult----get from $g$ by taking  points in our domain.

consider if $g$ can output all possible positive values:

considering points $(c,0), c\neq 0$. we get $g(c,0)=\frac{c^2 -0^2 }{&#124;c&#124; + &#124;0&#124;} = &#124;c&#124;$

thus, $g$ can take any positive value.

similarly, negative?

considering the points $(9,d),d\neq 0$ which give $g(0,d)=-&#124;d&#124;$

thus, $g$ can take any nagative value.

finally, observe that $g(1,1)=0$ , thus, the range of $g$ is $\mathbb{R}$

### Example 4 (sketch the domain and find the range)

1.$f(x,y)=\ln (1-x^2 -y^2)$

domain of $f(x,y)$ is $1-x^2 -y^2 >0$ , domain: $x^2 +y^2 <1$

![](\pics\math\math237-1.3.PNG)

range: $z \le 0$

2. $g(x,y)=\sqrt{16-x^2 +y^2}$

domain of $f(x,y)$ is $16-x^2 +y^2 \ge 0$, $x^2 -y^2 \le 16$

![](\pics\math\math237-1.4.PNG)

range: $z\ge 0$

## 1.2 geometric interpretation of $z=f(x,y)$

extend:
when we **graph** a function $y=f(x)$:

plot point $(a,f(a))$ in $xy$-plane:

think of $f(a)$ as representing the **height** of the graph $y=f(x)$ above (or below if negative) the $x$-axis at $x=a$.

define the **graph** of a function $f(x,y)$ as the set of all points $(a, b, f(a,b))$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $(a,b)\in D(f)$.

think of $f(a,b)$ as representing the **height** of the graph $z=f(x,y)$ above(or below if negative) the $xy$-plane at the point $(x,y)=(a,b)$

![](\pics\math\math237-1.5.PNG)

### Example 1 (a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$)

let $f$ be defined by $f(x,y)=x+2y+3$. we recognize this as the question of a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

![](\pics\math\math237-1.6.PNG)

in general, when $f$ is defined as $f(x,y)=c_1x+c_2y+c_3$, where $c_1, c_2. c_3$ are real constants, the graph of $z=f(x,y)$ is a plane.

### Def: Level Curves

**level curves**: 2-dimensional slices of the surface---to sketch these surfaces

the **level curves** of a function $f(x,y)$ are the curves

$f(x,y)=k$  where the values of $k$ come from the range of $f$.

### Example 2 (find the level curves)

find the level curves of the function defined by $f(x,y)=2x-3y+1$

sol:

we observe that $R(f)=\mathbb{R}$. so the level curves of $f$ are

$2x-3y+1=f(x,y)=k,k\in \mathbb{R}$

we can take any value of $k$ !!!

so, the level curves of $f$ are $2x-3y+1=f(x,y)=k,k\in \mathbb{R}$

for $k=0$, we get $2x-3y+1=0$ => $2x-3y=-1$

for $k=1$, we get $2x-3y+1=1$ => $2x-3y=0$

for $k=-2$, we get $2x-3y+1=-2$ => $2x-3y=-3$

setting $2x-3y+1=k$ defines the line $2x-3y+(1-k)=0.$

### 3D visualization

![](\pics\math\math237-1.9.PNG)

the level curve $f(x,y)=k$ is the **intersection** of $z=f(x,y)$ and the horizontal plane $z=k$.

thus, each value $k$ represents the height of that level curve above the $xy$-plane.

therefore, *the family of level curves* is often called a **contour map** or **topographic map** (等高线图)

### Example 3 (how to use level curves to sketch the surface)

sketch the level curves of $f(x,y)=x^2 +y^2$ and use them to sketch the surface $z=f(x,y)$

sol:

$R(f)=[0,\infity)$

for $k=0$, we get $x^2 +y^2 =0$

for $k=1$, we get $x^2 +y^2 =1$

for $k=2$, we get $x^2 +y^2 =2$

setting $x^2 +y^2 =k$ define a circle of radius $\sqrt{k}$ centred at the origin.

![](\pics\math\math237-1.10.PNG)

![](\pics\math\math237-1.11.PNG)

we get the surface, which is called a **paraboloid** (抛物面)

### Example 4 (level curves => surface)

sketch the level curves of $g(x,y)=x^2 -y^2$ and use them to sketch the surface $z=g(x,y)$

sol:
$D(g)=\mathbb{R}^2$ and $R(g)=\mathbb{R}$

for any $k\in \mathbb{R}$, we sketch the Level curves $x^2 -y^2 =k$ which we recognize as a family of hyperbolae and their asymptotes $y=\pm x$

we get hyperbolae along the $x$-axis for $k>0$

and hyperbolae along the $y$-axis for $k<0$.

for $k=0$, we get the asymptotes $y=\pm x$

![](\pics\math\math237-1.12.PNG)

use these to sketch the surface, we get a **saddle surface**

![](\pics\math\math237-1.13.PNG)

### Example 5 (level curves => surfaces)

sketch the level curves of $h(x,y)=x^2$ and use them to sketch the surface $z=h(x,y)$.

sol:

$D(h)=\mathbb{R}^2$ and $R(h)= &#92; z\in \mathbb{R} &#124; z\ge 0 &#92;$

thus, for $k\ge 0$ we have level curves $x^2 =k$ => $x=\mp \sqrt{k}$

level curves are pairs of vertical straight lines

for $k=1$, we get $x=\pm 1$

for $k=9/16$, we get $x=\pm 3/4$

for $k=1/4$, we get $x=\pm 1/2$

for $k=1/16$m we get $x=\pm 1/4$

![](\pics\math\math237-1.14.PNG)

using these to sketch the surface, we get a **parabolic cylinder**

### **applications**

isotherms: in weather, to show how curves of constant temperature

isobars: in barometric pressure charts to show curves of constant pressure

### Def: Cross Sections

a **cross section** of a surface $z=f(x,y)$ is the intersection of $z=f(x,y)$ with a vertical plane.

note: for sketching the graph of a surface $z=f(x,y)$ it is useful to consider the cross section formed by vertical planes $x=c$ and $y=d$.

### Example 6 (find cross section)

let $f(x,y)=x^2 +y^2$

the cross sections formed by intersecting $z=f(x,y)$ with $x=c$ for $c=0,1,2$ are:

$z=(0)^2 +y^2$, $z=(1)^2 +y^2$, and $z=(2)^2 +y^2$.

![](\pics\math\math237-1.16.PNG)

![](\pics\math\math237-1.17.PNG)

the cross sections formed by intersecting $z=f(x,y)$ with $y=d$ for $d=0,1,2$ are:

$z=x^2 +(0)^2$, $z=x^2 +(1)^2$, and $z=x^2 +(2)^2$

![](\pics\math\math237-1.18.PNG)

![](\pics\math\math237-1.19.PNG)

remark:

for simplicity, when you are asked to sketch the cross sections of a surface:

sketch the family of cross sections $z=f(c,y)$ and $z=f(x,d)$ formed by the intersection of the surface with the vertical planes $x=c$ and $y=d$.

as the level curves, the value of $c$ and $d$ can take on multiple values.

### Def: level surface

a **level surface** of a scalar function $f(x,y,z)$ is defined by $f(x,y,z)=k, k\in R(f)$

### Def: level Sets

a **level set** of a scalar function $f(\vec{x}), \vec{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined by

 $&#92;\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n &#124; f(\vec{x})=k, for k \in R(f) &#92;$

### Example 7

let $f$ be defined by:

$f(x_1, \dots, x_n)={x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 +\cdots +{x_n}^2$

the level sets of $f(\vec{x})=k$ in $\mathbb{R}^n (k>0)$ are called $(n-1)$-**spheres**, denoted by $S^{n-1}$.
