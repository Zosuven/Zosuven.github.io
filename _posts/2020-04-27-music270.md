### Chapter 1

##### **Music:**

aural art 

sounding forms, composed of tones arranged both in *<u>succession</u>* and as *<u>simultaneities</u>*

*succession:* 余音

*simultaneities:* 同时的声音



###### the form of the sound:

<span style="color:red">pluck</span> a guitar or violin string   =react in>  a slight tremor or vibration   =stir>  the surrounding air   <span style="color:blue">and</span>

​                                                                                                                             =impart>  a tremor to it 

compression-rarefaction waves  =>  fade by friction 

compression: 

the air molecules(分子) in contact with the string (at the instant(瞬间) of its release from our finger) are pushed away by the disturbance and are crowded together in an area or sphere of *compression*

rarefaction:

as the area of greater pressure moves outward, a sphere of lower pressure --- *rarefaction* forms behind it 



### Chapter 7 --- Harmonic Framework

- **Counterpoint** :
  the *relationship* between two melodies played together

  Ps: <span style="color:brown">*punctus*</span>(in Latin)

  ##### framework / tonal space (for melodic lines)

>how to make?
>increase the vertical distance between two melodies

- **homophony** :
  a kind of *music*  which is *homophony*
- **homophony** :
  the texture that all melodic lines of this larger music move in the *same rhythm*

- **harmonic intervals** :
  intervals formed by their simultaneous tones

>consonant:
>sound calm and stable
>ex: m6 M6 m10 M10

#### Soprano-Bass Framework

- **normal vocal ranges**:
  normal vocal ranges of Soprano and Bass span compound 5th:
  Soprano ascends from C4 and Bass ascends from E2 (occasionally extended by one tone at either extreme)

>**compound intervals**:
>can be spread out over several octaves

### chapter 8 --- Chordal succession

#### **Chords**

- tonal coalescence:

  aural(听觉的) phenomenon that we hears each complex as a  synthesis(整体), a composite sound

those blended sounds are called ***chords***

- **Bass** : foundation, footing of the chords

  thus, *chords are identified by the harmonic intervals formed between the bass and each upper voice of the homophony*

  ***we read chords up from the bass***



#### Tone

1. 音（Pitch） ex: 'A' or 'C'

   ps: 

   it also includes timbre (the quality of the sound), duration, and even intensity (the dynamic of the sound). In many forms of music, different pitches are altered by modulation(转调) or vibrato(颤音)

   ex:

   if a violinist plays an "E" and adds vibrato to the note, it is no longer *<u>a pure tone</u>*. It now has tiny modulations that might add warmth to the sound, but also alters its pitch. *<u>A pure tone</u>* has a sinusoidal waveform, which is a pattern of even and repetitive oscillation. The resulting sound is very even and steady. 

2. As a musical interval :

   tone(全音): a whole step (made up of 2 half-steps)

   semitone(半音): a half-step

3. quality of sound:

   the *<u>unique difference</u>* between voices of the same instrument and the color or mood of the voice (not to be confused with timbre). 

   On different instruments and in vocal music, a tone may be expressed in many different ways:

   a. 用弹奏技巧弹出不同的感觉 (piano)

   b. 用不同的发生技巧营造不同的感觉(vocal)



#### Consonant chords

- **def**: 

  its interval sound any combination of consonant simple and consonant interval series: 

  comprise 4 pitch classes:

  3 5 8

  3 6 8

  comprise 3 pitch classes:

  3 5

  3 6

##### **triad**

- <u>meaning:</u>  3 5 chord

- features:

  divides the perfect fifth into two thirds:

  one M3; one  m3

- **quality**:

  <u>minor</u>: m3 takes the lower position

- **root**:

  the lowest pitch of a triad 

  should be the chord's dynamic focus

##### Sixth Chord:

![](/pics/music/music-270-2.jpg)

When the triad's root is displaced to its upper octave, a 3 6 chord is created

sixth chord is considered as an *<u> inverted triad</u>*

they carry the same *<u>quality</u>* as their <u>parent triads</u>



##### Bass and Root:

- differences:

  **Bass:**

  lowest voice of the <u>harmonic frame</u> (永远在低音)

  **Root:**

  gernerating pitch of a chord (可能被移上去，triad的根音)

  dynamic center of a triad or sixth chord

- Ex:

  the root of a triad:  lies in the bass

  the root of a sixth: above the bass

##### **Diminished chords**

**diatonic  triad** taking **B** as its root :

divide a **diminished fifth** => chord dissonant 

### **Chapter 12 ---Tonic Confirmation**

#### **background:**

**Major scale (major tonality) 大调**：

| Notes in C Major                              | C               | D          | E       | F           | G        | A          | B            | C             |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **Degrees in solfege**                        | *Do*            | *Re*       | *Mi*    | *Fa*        | *Sol*    | *La*       | *Ti*         | *Do*          |
| **Interval sequence**                         | T               | T          | S       | T           | T        | T          | S            |               |
| **Traditional names**(used in tonal contexts) | Tonic(key note) | Supertonic | Mediant | Subdominant | Dominant | Submediant | leading tone | Tonic(Octave) |



**Cadence:**

乐句结尾： cadential event



**dominant-tonic event:**

the opening tonic chord meeting the dominant-tonic cadence:
