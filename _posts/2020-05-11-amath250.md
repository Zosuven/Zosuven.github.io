# Chapter 1

## 1.1 What is a Mathematical model?

4 steps in modeling a physical situation can involve a variety of mathematical techniques(geometry, algebra, approximation, and solurion of equations)

process of Mathematical modeling:

- **Problem statement**

  >a detailed and thorough description of the phenomena

- **Model creation**

  >the use of all relevant guiding principles to relate the quatities involved

  eg. results in equation, a mathematical model representing the phenomena

  when creating a model we need to:

  1. write down what is known(a picture to help)

  2. define any varibles and constants, and their units of measure

  3. identify what governing principles apply

  4. express these principles in terms of the variables

- **Solution**

  >analytically, graphically, numerically solution of equation

- **Intepretation**

  >interpretation of what the model predicts as compared to observed phenomenon

  analyzing and interpreting a model may involve

  1. solving various types of equations

  2. checking how the results compare with reality

  3. identifying sources of error in both the model and the Solution

  4. thinking of ways of improve or generalize the model

### **Scenario**

A sailor climbs the rigging of a "tall ship" to the top of the foremost mast. How far can he see?

![](\pics\math\amath250-1.1-1.jpg)

4 steps of modeling the phenomena:

##### **Problem**:

give that the earth has the radius $R$,
how far away is the horizon(the farthest point the eye can see beore Earth curves out beneath our view) for an observer
with eye level at height $h$, where $h$ is the height above the surface of earth?

![](\pics\math\amath250-1.1-2.jpg)

##### **Model**:

in the diagram *1.1-2* , the height $h$ is exaggerated(actually $R >> h$ <span style="color:purple">not the ratio</span>
shown in the diagram)

By the *Pythagorean theorem* , we see that the distance $x$ from observer at $O$
to the horizon at $T$  is related to $h$ and $R$ by the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 = &(R+h)^2 - R^2 \\\\
&R^2 + h^2 + 2Rh - R^2 \\\\
&2Rh +h^2
\end{aligned}
$$

##### **Solution**:

Since the altitude $h$ of the observer's eye is much smaller than the Earth's radius $R$

the term $h^2$ is <span style="color:red">***negligible***</span> compared to $2Rh$

Thus, the equation predicts $x^2 \approx 2Rh$ or $x \approx \sqrt{2Rh}$, since $x\ge 0$

##### **Interpretation**:

we can now predict horizon distance for a variety of situations

for example,

for the given Scenario, the Earth's radius is $R \approx 6371 \operatorname{km}$,

and we assume a $2 \operatorname{m}$ tall sailor oberving from central mast on the "Dar Mlodziezy sailing" ship,

for which the height of the central mast is $197 \operatorname{ft}$ above the deck, or about $66 \operatorname{m}$
above water.

thus $h= 66+2= 68 \operatorname{m}$, so the horizon is approximately $\sqrt{2\times 6371000\times 68} \approx 29436 \operatorname{m}$, or $29.4\operatorname{km}$ distant.


<span style="color:red">✮</span> acknowledge possible sources of errored

result from physical features of the situation that we ignored (in formulating our mathematical model)

we neglected:

- haze created by moisture/particule matter in the atmosphere(影响能见度)

- atmospheric refraction (the same effect that makes the sun look bigger at sunset), which causes a further error, adding about 9 percent to out predictions

- if the viewer is on land rather than water, the topography of the Earth's surface will come into play.

#### exercise

Two observer stand, one on each of two similar ships sailing on a becalmed sea.

Find the minimum distance between the two ships such that neither observer can see the other's ship if the observer have

a. the same height $h$

b. different height $h_1$ and $h_2$

try:

a.according to the model, $x= \sqrt{2Rh}$

b.according to the model, $x= max(\sqrt{2Rh_1} ,\sqrt{2Rh_2} )$ 

# Chapter 2

### First order differential equation with initial condition (IVP)

  **IVP**: initial value problem (IVP)

  **IC**: initial condition (IC) (which is $y(0)=y_0$)

    $\frac{dy}{dt}=a(y-y_e ),y(0)=y_0$

    its **solution**: $y(t)=y_e +(y_0 -y_e)e^{at}$

    > the *behavior* of the **solution** depends critically on the signs of the constants $a$ and $(y_0 - y_e)$

    > if $a<0$, then as $t->\infty$ $y(t)->y_e$

    > if $a>0$, then as $t-> \infty$ $&#124;y(t)&#124;->\infty$

how to find the solution???

let $z(t)=y(t)-y_e$, so that $\frac{dz}{dt}=\frac{dy}{dt}-0$   (since $y_e$ is constant)

tansform this **DE** to

$\frac{dy}{dt}=a(y-y_e) => \frac{dz}{dt} =az$ this is the simplest **DE** that we get $z(t)=C e^{at}$

so $y(t)=y_e +z(t)=y_e +Ce^{at}$

applying the IC $y(0)=y_0$ gives  $y(0)=y_e+Ce^0 => C=y_0 -y_e$

thus the solution to the TVP is $y(t)=y_e +(y_0 -y_e)e^{at}$

# Chapter 3

### differential equation (DE)

**Definition**:

> a equation that relates an *unknown function* (ex:dependent variable $y(t)$) to its own *rate(s) of change* (derivative(s))

a **DE** of the form:

    $\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y(t), t)$

> they are classified by the **order** and **linearity**

#### order

  the order of a DE is the order of the **highest derivative** in the equation

#### ODE or PDE

**ordinary differential equation** (ODE):

  involves only one *independent* variable

**partial differential equation** (PDF):

  more than one *independent* variable

#### linearity

**linear**:

  any dependent variables(unknown functions) and their derivatives which appear in the equation do so in a linear combination

  > linear combination: a sum of terms, each of which is a constant, or a function of the independent variable times the dependent variable or one of its derivatives.

  otherwise, it is called **nonlinear**

### Solution

#### solution of ODE

  a function $y(t)$ is the **solution** of an ODE if subsitution of $y(t)$ into the DE produces an identity valid for all $t$ in some interval.

#### general solution of ODE
  a family of functions which represents all (or nearly all) possible solutions.

  (occasionally, special solutions exist outside this family)

  > ex. $y=Ce^{2t}$

#### particular solution

   a special solution (where the arbitrary constants are specific numbers) will normally be referred to as a particular solution.

#### integral curve (implicit solution)

  is a geometric representation of a specofoc solution to an ordinary differential equation or system of equations.
